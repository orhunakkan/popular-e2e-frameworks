Feature: Implicit Assertions
    Scenario: Validate class, text, html, and visibility of specific content in assertion-table
        Given the page 'https://example.cypress.io/commands/assertions' is accessible
        When Cypress finds the last 'tbody tr' within 'assertion-table' class
        Then there should be a 'success' class
        And the first 'td' should contain text, html, and match 'Column content'
        And it should be visible

    Scenario: Validate link within assertions-link class
        Given the page 'https://example.cypress.io/commands/assertions' is accessible
        When Cypress gets the '.assertions-link'
        Then it should have 'active' class
        And it should have 'href' attribute
        And the href should include 'cypress.io'

Feature: Explicit Assertions
    Scenario: Test hardcoded assertions to be true
        Given the statement is true
        Then the expression should be true

    Scenario: Validate object and string matches
        Given an object with 'foo: bar'
        And a string 'FooBar'
        Then the object should deeply equal to {foo: 'bar'}
        And the string should match pattern '/bar$/i'

    Scenario: Test text content within multiple paragraphs
        Given the class '.assertions-p' contains p tags with certain texts
        Then those paragraphs should be 3 in number
        And should have certain expected texts

    Scenario: Test element existence and class name match using callback function
        Given class '.docs-header' contains a div
        Then the div's class name should match the pattern '/heading-/'
        And the div's text content should be 'Introduction'

    Scenario: Assert shape of an object
        Given an object named 'person' with keys 'name' and 'age'
        Then the given 'person' object should be an object

    Scenario: Retry the test until the assertion passes
        Given an element with id 'random-number' containing a floating point number as text
        Then the text should be converted to a number
        And the number should be between 1 and 10 inclusive
