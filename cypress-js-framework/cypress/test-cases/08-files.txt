Feature: Files
  Scenario: Load a fixture
    Given I visit "https://example.cypress.io/commands/files"
    And I establish a fixture alias 'example' with 'example.json'
    And I intercept GET requests to '**/comments/*' with fixture 'example.json' and alias as 'getComment'
    When I click on '.fixture-btn'
    Then I wait for '@getComment'
    Then the response body should have a 'name' property
    And the 'name' property should include 'Using fixtures to represent data'

  Scenario: Load a fixture using 'cy.fixture()' or 'require'
    Given I visit "https://example.cypress.io/commands/files"
    And I establish a fixture alias 'example' with 'example.json'
    When these are loaded successfully
    Then The fixture in the e2e context should deeply equal to 'requiredExample'

  Scenario: Read file contents
    Given I visit "https://example.cypress.io/commands/files"
    When I read the Cypress configuration file
    Then the file content should be a string

  Scenario: Write to a file
    Given I visit "https://example.cypress.io/commands/files"
    When I make a request to 'https://jsonplaceholder.cypress.io/users'
    And I write the response body to 'cypress/fixtures/users.json'
    Then the first user name in 'users' fixture should exist
    When I write '{ "id": 8739, "name": "Jane", "email": "jane@example.com" }' to 'cypress/fixtures/profile.json'
    Then the profile name in 'profile' fixture should equal 'Jane'
